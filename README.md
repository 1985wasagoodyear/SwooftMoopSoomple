## This App:

Is unfinished. (I'll finish it another time.)

Upon receiving user location, it creates a target location, with the intention for the user to walk to the region described by this location.

After that, something else can happen. 

Perhaps.

This is also untested.


## Objective

To demonstrate some of the different capacities of using GPS services (CLLocation) and the first-party map framework (MapKit) in order to demonstrate different opportunities and capabilities that a given application can leverage.


## Topics Demonstrated Here:

* 1. Rendering & Tracking a User's Location.
* 2. Creating A Pin (Annotation) for any given location.
* 3. Defining a 2D Region for a user to interact with, via Geolocation
